# Summary

 To meet this need, we have developed a library of pulse design
tools as part of the SigPy Python package 2 , which we call SigPy.RF. Here we detail the softwareâ€™s organization and goals, provide examples, and show
an experimental validation of parallel transmission (pTx) pulses designed using SigPy.RF.

# Statement of need

While RF pulse developers increasingly share code online in independent repositories, no unified set of common pulse design tools is
maintained in a rigorous and consistent manner with easy-to-read code and tutorials. An open source pulse design code library would facilitate the
development and dissemination of novel techniques and the comparison of approaches, similar to how BART 1 , SigPy 2 , and MIRT 3 have made advanced
parallel imaging and compressed sensing reconstruction methods widely accessible.

# About the SigPy Package

# Target Audience

The SigPy.RF toolbox has been developed for the use of MRI researchers focusing on pulse sequence design, MRI physics, signal processing and optimization. We believe that it will serve as an essential building block of more general image acquisition tools which require specialized RF pulses. The toolbox has already been incorporated into open-source sequence development software such as Pulseq [rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html) and PyPulseq [rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html). We also envisage PyPulseq to be utilized for replicability and
reproducibility studies. The package could also serve as a hands-on teaching aid for MRI faculty and students. Beginners can
get started with the bundled example pulse sequences. More familiar users can import the
appropriate packages to construct and deploy custom pulse sequence

# Citations

Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
format.

If you want to cite a software repository URL (e.g. something on GitHub without a preferred
citation) then you can do it with the example BibTeX entry below for @fidgit.

For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)"

# Figures

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }
