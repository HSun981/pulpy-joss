abstract = {Purpose: Implementing new magnetic resonance experiments, or sequences, often involves extensive programming on vendor-specific platforms, which can be time consuming and costly. This situation is exacerbated when research sequences need to be implemented on several platforms simultaneously, for example, at different field strengths. This work presents an alternative programming environment that is hardware-independent, open-source, and promotes rapid sequence prototyping. Methods: A novel file format is described to efficiently store the hardware events and timing information required for an MR pulse sequence. Platform-dependent interpreter modules convert the file to appropriate instructions to run the sequence on MR hardware. Sequences can be designed in high-level languages, such as MATLAB, or with a graphical interface. Spin physics simulation tools are incorporated into the framework, allowing for comparison between real and virtual experiments. Results: Minimal effort is required to implement relatively advanced sequences using the tools provided. Sequences are executed on three different MR platforms, demonstrating the flexibility of the approach. Conclusion: A high-level, flexible and hardware-independent approach to sequence programming is ideal for the rapid development of new sequences. The framework is currently not suitable for large patient studies or routine scanning although this would be possible with deeper integration into existing workflows.

@article{Stocker2010,
abstract = {A new open-source software project is presented, JEMRIS, the J{\"{u}}lich Extensible MRI Simulator, which provides an MRI sequence development and simulation environment for the MRI community. The development was driven by the desire to achieve generality of simulated three-dimensional MRI experiments reflecting modern MRI systems hardware. The accompanying computational burden is overcome by means of parallel computing. Many aspects are covered that have not hitherto been simultaneously investigated in general MRI simulations such as parallel transmit and receive, important offresonance effects, nonlinear gradients, and arbitrary spatiotemporal parameter variations at different levels. The latter can be used to simulate various types of motion, for instance. The JEMRIS user interface is very simple to use, but nevertheless it presents few limitations. MRI sequences with arbitrary waveforms and complex interdependent modules are modeled in a graphical user interface-based environment requiring no further programming. This manuscript describes the concepts, methods, and performance of the software. Examples of novel simulation results in active fields of MRI research are given. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Purpose: An automated algorithm for generating realizable MR gradient and shim coil layouts based on the boundary element method is presented here. The overall goal is to reduce postprocessing effort and thus enable for rapid prototyping of new coil designs. For a given surface mesh and target field, the algorithm generates a connected, non-overlapping wire path. Methods: The proposed algorithm consists of several steps: Stream function optimization, two-dimensional surface projection, potential discretization, topological contour sorting, opening and interconnecting contours, and finally adding non-overlapping return paths. Several technical parameters such as current strength, inductance and field accuracy are assessed for quality control. Results: The proposed method is successfully demonstrated in four different examples. All exemplary results demonstrate high accuracy with regard to reaching the respective target field. The optimal discretization for a given stream function is found by generating multiple layouts while varying the input parameter values. Conclusion: The presented algorithm allows for a rapid generation of interconnected coil layouts with high flexibility and low discretization error. This enables to reduce the overall post-processing effort. The source code of this work is publicly available (https://github.com/Philipp-MR/CoilGen).},

@article{SravanRavi2019,
abstract = {Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical component of healthcare. MRI data is acquired by playing a series of radio-frequency and magnetic field gradient pulses. Designing these pulse sequences requires knowledge of specific programming environments depending on the vendor hardware (generations) and software (revisions) intended for implementation. This impedes the pace of prototyping. Pulseq (Layton et al., 2017) introduced an open source file standard for pulse sequences that can be deployed on Siemens/GE via TOPPE (Nielsen & Noll, 2018)/Bruker platforms. In this work, we introduce PyPulseq, which enables pulse sequence programming in Python. Its advantages are zero licensing fees and easy integration with deep learning methods developed in Python. PyPulseq is aimed at MRI researchers, faculty, students , and other allied field researchers such as those in neuroscience. We have leveraged this tool for several published research works (Poojar, Geethanath, Reddy, & Venkatesan, n.d.; Ravi et al. Statement of need MRI is a non-invasive diagnostic imaging tool. It is a critical component of healthcare and has a significant impact on diagnosis and treatment assessment. Structural, functional and metabolic MRI generate valuable information that aid in the accurate diagnosis of a wide range of pathologies. A unique strength of MRI is the ability to visualise diverse pathologies achieved by the flexibility in designing tailored pulse sequences. MRI pulse sequences are a collection of radio-frequency and gradient waveforms that are executed on the scanner hardware to acquire raw data. Research efforts on pulse sequence design are directed at achieving faster scan times, improving tissue contrast and increasing Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). However, designing pulse sequences requires knowledge of specific programming environments depending on the vendor hardware (generations) and software (revisions) intended for implementation. Typically, MRI researchers program and simulate the pulse sequences on computers and execute them on MRI scanners. This typically involves considerable effort, impeding the pace of proto-typing and therefore research and development. This also hampers multi-site multi-vendor studies as it requires researchers to be acquainted with each vendor's programming environment. Furthermore, harmonizing acquisition across MRI vendors will enable reproducible research. This work introduces an open source tool that enables pulse sequence programming for Siemens/GE/Bruker platforms in Python, based on the Pulseq standard (Layton et al., 2017).},

abstract = {Parallel excitation has been introduced as a means of accelerating multidimensional, spatially-selective excitation using multiple transmit coils, each driven by a unique RF pulse. Previous approaches to RF pulse design in parallel excitation were either formulated in the frequency domain or restricted to echo-planar trajectories, or both. This paper presents an approach that is formulated as a quadratic optimization problem in the spatial domain and allows the use of arbitrary k-space trajectories. Compared to frequency domain approaches, the new design method has some important advantages. It allows for the specification of a region of interest (ROI), which improves excitation accuracy at high speedup factors. It allows for magnetic field inhomogeneity compensation during excitation. Regularization may be used to control integrated and peak pulse power. The effects of Bloch equation nonlinearity on the large-tip-angle excitation error of RF pulses designed with the method are investigated, and the utility of Tikhonov regularization in mitigating this error is demonstrated. {\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {New theoretical and practical concepts are presented for considerably enhancing the performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by means of arrays of multiple receiver coils. Sensitivity encoding (SENSE) is based on the fact that receiver sensitivity generally has an encoding effect complementary to Fourier preparation by linear field gradients. Thus, by using multiple receiver coils in parallel scan time in Fourier imaging can be considerably reduced. The problem of image reconstruction from sensitivity encoded data is formulated in a general fashion and solved for arbitrary coil configurations and k-space sampling patterns. Special attention is given to the currently most practical case, namely, sampling a common Cartesian grid with reduced density. For this case the feasibility of the proposed methods was verified both in vitro and in vivo. Scan time was reduced to one-half using a two-coil array in brain imaging. With an array of five coils double-oblique heart images were obtained in one-third of conventional scan time. Magn Reson Med 42:952-962, 1999.},

@article{Martin2022,
abstract = {Purpose: To perform B + 1-selective excitation using the Bloch-Siegert shift for spatial localization. Theory and Methods: A B + 1-selective excitation is produced by an radiofre-quency (RF) pulse consisting of two summed component pulses: an off-resonant pulse that induces a B + 1-dependent Bloch-Siegert frequency shift and a frequency-selective excitation pulse. The passband of the pulse can be tailored by adjusting the frequency content of the frequency-selective pulse, as in conventional B 0 gradient-localized excitation. Fine magnetization profile control is achieved by using the Shinnar-Le Roux algorithm to design the frequency-selective excitation pulse. Simulations analyzed the pulses' robust-ness to off-resonance, their suitability for multi-echo spin echo pulse sequences, and how their performance compares to that of rotating-frame selective excita-tion pulses. The pulses were evaluated experimentally on a 47.5 mT MRI scanner using an RF gradient transmit coil. Multiphoton resonances produced by the pulses were characterized and their distribution across B + 1 predicted. Results: With correction for varying B + 1 across the desired profile, the proposed pulses produced selective excitation with the specified profile characteristics. The pulses were robust against off-resonance and RF amplifier distortion, and suitable for multi-echo pulse sequences. Experimental profiles closely matched simulated patterns. Conclusion: The Bloch-Siegert shift can be used to perform B 0-gradient-free selective excitation, enabling the excitation of slices or slabs in RF gradient-encoded MRI.},
